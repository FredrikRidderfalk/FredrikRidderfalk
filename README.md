💻 I’m currently working for Odevo building a PWA for work order management, a back office app for property managers, a customer portal for board members & tenants, a component library, and a feature flag management platform.

🧑‍🏫 My course on accessible development has launched through the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path as well as through the [MDN Web Development Certificate Course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/core/accessibility/), currently reaching **+1.5 million developers worldwide**

🎬 My course has been featured on [freecodecamp](https://youtu.be/e2nkq3h1P68?si=UW_NQr-N8YwV_9tm)

🚀 Changed careers from biotech researcher and then high school biology teacher to developer [after three months of self-studies](https://podcast.scrimba.com/46)

💜 I've been running workshops and a community dedicated to help aspiring new developers break into tech
